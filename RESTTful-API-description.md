This chapter must provide a good overview of the Web API that your group is going to develop during the course. You should not focus in implementation aspects such as database structure,  interfaces or the request/responses formats. We recommend that you look into existing APIs (see Related work below) before writing the description for your own API.

In this section you must describe JUST the RESTful API, NOT THE CLIENT. Remember that client and Web API should be totally decoupled.

<h3>SECTION GOALS:</h3>
<ol>
<li> Understand what is an API</li>
<li>Describe the project topic API</li>
<li>Describe how the API will be used in the project</li>
</ol>

Describe the Web API briefly and comment which is the main functionality that it exposes to clients. A really short version of an overview for the RESTful Web API could be: 

<em>“The discussion forum Web API offers different functionalities to structure non-real-time conversations among the people of a group about topics they are interested in certain topic. Messages are grouped in Threads, that at the same time are grouped in Topics. The messages are accessible to anyone, but posts can only be created by providing credentials of a registered user [...] Clients using this service may implement applications similar to [...]“</em>

Justify also why you want to implement this API.

The general description IS NOT just a description of the functionality. Try to market your API to potential customers.
