# RESTful API description


**DEADLINE 1**.

---
---

### SUMMARY

This section must provide a good overview of the Web API that your group is going to develop during the course. You should not focus in implementation aspects such as database structure,  interfaces or the request/responses formats. We recommend that you look into existing APIs (see Related work below) before writing the description for your own API.

**In this section you must describe JUST the RESTful API, NOT THE CLIENT**. Remember that client and Web API should be totally decoupled.

**SECTION GOALS**:

* Understand what is an API
* Describe the project topic API
* Describe how the API will be used in the project


## Main concepts and relations
## API uses
## Related work
## Resources allocation
